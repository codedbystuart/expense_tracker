# Expenses Tracker Application
Expenses tracker, is an application that enables a user to track his expenses and spending behavior. It uses Sequelize, a promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server.

In this application, I demonstrate Test Driven Development and writing of clean code.
